# GLAB

![Preview image](/assets/Capture.D.JPG)

This serves as my final project for **Computer Graphics** course **2017 Fall**.

I will continue improving it for fun. In general, I am iOS developer. Woking on Windows/Visual Studio/C++ really slow me down, but worth trying. Meanwhile, it's possible migrating it to Mac/Linux, since there is no windows specific API in the dependency. But working on MacBook Pro means over heating and noisy fan, then more importantly a much weaker GPU in the aluminum unibody. XXX, Apple is deprecating OpenGL, I shall move to Metal API after finishing my to-do list.

## Features

- Deferred shading
- Light source Bloom
- HDR enviromment map
- PBR metallic roughness
- Fresnel Schlick
- Cook-Torrance BRDF
- Microfacet GGX+Smith
- Image-based lighting

## To-do

- **SSAO**
- TAA / MSAA
- Depth of field
- Parallax mapping  
- Volumetric lighting
- Support HDR display
- **Subsurface Scattering**

## To-fix

- Dynamic environment mapping
- Error: 1280 Unknown error
